navigate to appropriate directory (where your iso and checksum file are)

shasum -a 256 openSUSE-Leap-15.3-2-DVD-x86_64-Build24.5-Media.iso | tee sha256.txt
ls
cat openSUSE-Leap-15.3-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256 >> sha256.txt
cat sha256.txt
sort sha256.txt | uniq >> sorted.txt
ls
cat sorted.txt

if sorted.txt has only one line, then you're golden.
